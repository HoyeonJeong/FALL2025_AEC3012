## Objective of Class
- Students may learn about advancement of agricultural technology, especially, Information
Technology (IT). Students will gain a practical way to overcome problems that farms or
agribusiness currently have. Especially, students are encouraged to learn about how
information works for farms and agribusiness, which is a key in a modern industry.
- Recently, data-driven decision making (DDDM) has been applicable to agribusiness. It is a
process of making decisions based on an analysis of farm data rather than intuition, a
priori experience, and guesswork. Agricultural informatics begins by exploring how to
utilize data for agribusiness and farm management, and it highlights the necessity of
data-driven decision-making in the theory of agricultural production.
- Students will study about a variety of sources for information and agribusiness issued
from Statistics Korea, Korea Rural Economic Institute, and the Ministry of Agriculture.
Information about farmers gathered through investigation using surveys is a great source
for policymakers and stakeholders. We will see together why the government needs
information and why they want to develop infrastructure for public informatization.
